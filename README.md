# 📊 Strategic Management Information System (SMIS) – Demo

This is a **demo version** of a Strategic Management Information System (SMIS) designed for public institutions to manage plans, reports, and KPIs across an organizational hierarchy.

> 🚨 This repository contains sample data and public-safe code. Sensitive configurations and actual deployment data are excluded.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔧 Setting Module
- Language, Planning Year, Reporting Period, and Measurement Unit setup
- Hierarchical KPI settings (type, behavior, dis-aggregation levels)
- The organization Goals, Strategies, and Objectives Management module allows administrators
  and planners to define, align, and monitor the institution’s strategic direction. It supports
  hierarchical planning from high-level goals down to actionable objectives and ensures that all
  departments and activities are contributing toward the organizations's vision and mission. Allow
  planners to add or modify goals/strategies/objectives at runtime based on organizations board
  decisions or evolving needs.
  
**- **Office structure configuration**
This module provides a flexible and scalable way to represent the hierarchical structure of a
organization's administrative and academic units. Offices (e.g., President Office, Vice President
Offices, Directorates, Colleges, Departments, Units) can be structured in a parent-child relationship
to accurately reflect the real-world organizational hierarchy of the institution. This allows for more
effective governance, reporting, and KPI cascading.
**
### 📈 Plan Module
  **Plan Submission**: The act of a department/unit submitting its work plan for review.
  **Plan Review**: Evaluation by reviewers to check for alignment, feasibility, completeness, and
    correctness.
  **Plan Approval**: Final authorization by planning officers, administrators, or leadership.
 **Feedback Loop**: Reviewer comments and suggestions sent back to the submitter for
    updates.
- Create, edit, view, and approve organizational plans
- Plan submission by office
- View plans through office hierarchy

### 📊 Reporting Module
- Submit performance reports
- Report approval workflows
- View reports by office hierarchy

### 👥 User Management
- Users, roles, and permission management
- Role-based access control

- The Users, Roles, and Privileges Management module provides a secure, flexible, and scalable
  system to manage user access control throughout the application. It allows administrators to
  dynamically create and manage users, define custom roles, assign privileges (permissions) to those
  roles, and associate users with roles. This approach supports the principle of Role-Based Access
  Control (RBAC) while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to evolving organizational needs.
